# configs

These are my most used configuration files.

 I use them when I migrate to a new env and miss my familiar work env.
 I also have few scripts which I wrote because It saves me the boilerplate work that I have to do while starting a new project.
> ***Details:*** <br>
> ***rc** - `ALL RC files`<br>
> **ccreate** - `script to setup cpp environment for a new project, most of it remains same. It isn't full fledged, requires some customization.`
